# Visual-Circuit-Designer
Visual-Circuit-Designer is web-based platform that could provide students and learners good experience in designing circuits similar to the Block Diagrams (like on Computer Architecture), but without the need to install Quartus Prime or huge Virtual box image.

### <div align="center">Project goal</div>

The goal of our project is to create web-based platform for designing, simulating, and managing digital logic circuits with an intuitive interface.

### <div align="center">Project Context Diagram</div>

![Project Context Diagram](./docs/usage/projectContextDiagram.png)

#### Key Components 
1. User(student/engineers who will use out product)
2. Database(to store projects and users information)
3. Frontend(User Interface with which the user interacts)
4. Backend(this part user can not see, bur it exists)
5. Runner node(to run simulation)

### <div align="center">Feature Roadmap</div>

- [x] Add drag and drop to place circuits on grid
- [x] Add simulation with ability to change inputs in real time
- [x] Add ability to locally store projects
- [x] Add ability to upload projects from users device
- [ ] Add ability to store projects in the cloud storage
- [ ] Add ability to share projects among users community
- [x] Add multiple tabs to work on several projects at the same time
- [x] Add multiple themes of UI to make it more comfortable
- [ ] Add reusable custom blocks to simplify complex designs

### <div align="center">Usage Instructions</div>

Follow these steps to launch and explore the MVP v2:

1. **Open the Application**  
  - Navigate to [Visual Circuit Designer](https://www.visual-circuit-designer.ru)

2. **Access**  
  - The service is **completely free** and **open**.  
  - **No registration** or user account is required.

3. **Core Functionality**  
  - **Create & Edit** logical circuits using basic components.  
  - **Configure** various global settings via the **Settings** menu.

4. **Exploration & Testing**  
- Once the page loads, you’ll land directly in the workspace.  
- Use the **Menu** to drag-and-drop components onto the canvas.
- Switch between tools and pick different wire styles (bezier, step and straight) directly from the toolbar to control how connections are drawn.
- Open the **Settings** panel to fine-tune circuit and application options.

### <div align="center">Project Installation</div>
