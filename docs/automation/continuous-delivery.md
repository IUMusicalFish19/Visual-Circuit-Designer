## <div align="center"> Overview </div>

We have two links through which user can access the project:
1. [main](https://www.visual-circuit-designer.ru/) branch
  
    This branch is the final branch where bug-free features are added.
2. [dev](https://dev.visual-circuit-designer.ru/) branch

     This is the branch where we add features and test them to see if there are any bugs. If there are no bugs, then this branch is merged with the ```main``` branch.
