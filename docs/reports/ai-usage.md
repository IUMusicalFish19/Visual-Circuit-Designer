# AI Usage for this project

## Week 1
We used ChatGPT to reformulate questions by the Mom test and to review technologies and libraries applicable to the project.

## Week 2
We asked ChatGPT about Socket.io(JS library), about FastAPI(Python framework), and how to work with Radix(React library).

## Week 3
We used to add theme support, a file with color variables for all color themes was created. While the color scheme was hand-picked for the light and dark themes, the rest of the themes were generated using AI based on the first two themes.

## Week 4
We did not use AI this week.

## Week 5
We used AI for creating a template for bugs, because we never created them, and template for pull requests, because connecting them to issues with the github interface was more convenient for us. 

## Week 6
We did not use AI this week.

## Week 7
We used AI for accelerated learning of technologies (sqlalchemy), for understanding best practices of writing different architectures.
